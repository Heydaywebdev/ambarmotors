              - We may use your Information to send you information about our Services or the services of our
              Business Partners, including new products and promotions. Additionally, we may provide your
              Information to our Business Partners to contact you directly about their products and services, if
              we think you would be interested. Some advertisements may come from Third Parties called “ad
              networks.” Ad networks may include ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors, and research
              firms. We do not provide PII to any ad networks for use not related to the Services. In some cases,
              advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to those who fit a certain general
              profile category or may be based on information inferred from the Information provided by you,
              your Services usage patterns, or your activity on Third Party services, including over time and
              across properties and devices. By using the Services, you consent to us providing you with
              marketing materials, which may include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong class="italic">Direct Marketing:</strong> Communications or advertisements sent directly to you by Ambar or our

                you products or services that may interest you.
              </li>
              <li><strong class="italic">Advertisements:</strong> Advertisements and commercials from us or Third Parties. Note that if you
                click on any Third-Party advertisements, you may be transferred to a website of the Third
                Party or receive other messages, information or offers from the advertiser and/or other Third
                Parties, and these advertisers and/or Third Parties may use their own Tracking Tools to collect
                information in order to send you advertisements and for their legitimate business interests.
              </li>
              <li><strong class="italic">Interest-Based Advertisements:</strong> Content and advertisements personalized to your interests,
                which are inferred from your activity on our Services and other sites and services, and based
                on information gathered by us or Third Parties using Tracking Tools. These advertisements
                may be served to you on our Services or other services, sites, or apps.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may withdraw your consent through the “Contact Us” portal of the Website. Please note that
              even if you choose to remove your Information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while
              you’re browsing online, however they may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally,
              many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they
              have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the
              types of targeted advertisements you may receive. Please note that if you opt-out of targeted
              advertising, we may still track your use of the Services for analytics, operations and security
              purposes.
